# `aside`

A dumb programming(?) assistant that does quite a few random things. These
include, but are not limited to:
- [ ] (Recusively) scanning remote or local html for links.
    - [x] Local
    - [ ] Remote
    - [ ] Recursive-ness(?)
- [ ] Calculating upper and lower bound memory allocations for zig functions.
- [ ] A preprocessor for zig, i.e. comptime++, via `build.zig`.
- [ ] External LSP-like websocket dashboard.
- [ ] And more stuff I have yet to think of, mostly just small tools.
