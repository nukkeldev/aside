# `aside`

A dumb CLI assistant that does quite a few random things. These (could) include, 
but are not limited to:
- [x] (Recusively) scanning remote or local html for links.
    - [x] Local
    - [x] Remote
    - [x] Recursive-ness
- [ ] Calculating upper and lower bound memory allocations for zig functions.
- [ ] A preprocessor for zig, i.e. comptime++, via `build.zig`.
- [ ] A natural-language esque REPL.
- [ ] External LSP-like websocket dashboard.
- [ ] And more stuff I have yet to think of, mostly just small tools.
